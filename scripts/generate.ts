/**
 * The specification in `src/spec/` is the source of truth; this writes down what follows from it.
 *
 *   pnpm generate
 *
 * Boring on purpose (`REQUIREMENTS.md` §28): read the registry, normalize it once, hand the model
 * to small emitters that only build strings, then write everything in a single pass. No emitter
 * touches the filesystem, so what is generated can be reasoned about without tracing writes.
 *
 * **The banner carries no date and no version.** CI regenerates and asserts the tree did not
 * change; anything that moves on its own turns that check into a permanent failure.
 *
 * It imports from `dist/` because Node's type stripping will not resolve a `.js` specifier to a
 * `.ts` file, so `pnpm generate` builds first.

\`confirmed\` means two independent implementations agree and we have not run it; \`observed\`
means one does; \`inferred\` means it follows from something next to it; \`unknown\` means the
sources disagree.
