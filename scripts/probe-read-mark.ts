/**
 * Two claims about reading, measured at once (`RES-11`, and the fix of #122). Run by hand, never by
 * CI, and only with the owner's yes.
 *
 *   pnpm probe:read-mark            # the first channel with 2+ unread posts
 *   pnpm probe:read-mark <chat>     # or this one: an id or the exact title
 *
 * One login. In a chat with at least two unread messages it
 * 1. reads the last two **without** `interactive`, as the web client's history request is sent;
 * 2. marks read up to the older of the two, with `mark` = that message's time.
 * If MAX then answers `unread: 1`, reading marked nothing and the mark works by time, so the newest
 * stays unread. `0` cannot tell the two apart. The older message is marked read — that is the
 * owner's yes; a channel shows no reader to a person the way a dialog does.
 *
 * Printed: the chat's kind, counts and the verdict. Never a title, an id or a text.
