 * The client's own approval shows the arguments as the model wrote them — `chat: "Team"`. The form
 * shows the chat that name became and the whole text, which is what the owner is actually agreeing
 * to. The first call writes nothing; the SDK shows the form and calls again with the answer.
 *
 * The answer is bound to what the form showed: `requestState` carries an HMAC of the tool, every
 * argument with its chats resolved, a nonce and an expiry, under a key that never leaves this
 * process. The state round-trips through the client, so without the key an answer given for one
 * message could be carried to another, or to another tool; the nonce is spent on first use, so a
 * yes cannot be replayed. A client that cannot show a form fails the call in the SDK, before the
 * second call — nothing is written.
