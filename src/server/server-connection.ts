/**
 * **A command's connection: `max serve`'s, shared** (`MAX-35`, `NEED-229`).
 *
 * One connection to MAX per profile, whoever asks — CLI commands, `max mcp`, `max watch`. INIT
 * and LOGIN are answered by the server's own login; **every other request goes over its
 * connection, sends included**. The server runs the send guards on every write and journals it;
 * the command's client checks too, so a refusal comes before an upload, and journals only that.
 *
 * Before the first request, `ensure` replaces a server a command started under another build; with
 * none answering, it starts one and waits for it. A connection of the command's own
 * is opened only when there is no `ensure` (the owner said `serve: false`) and no server, or for
 * a token being tried out (`max session start`), which is by definition not the server's.
