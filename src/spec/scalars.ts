 * The two directions an id travels, and why they are not the same schema.

 * MAX ids are 64-bit. `asId` in `../protocol/frame.ts` is the read direction: whatever arrived —
 * a number when small, a bigint when not — leaves as a string, because an id is an identifier and
 * never arithmetic. The write direction did not exist, and `Number(id)` was standing in for it:
 * `Number("7268926000000000001")` is `7268926000000000000`, which is a different chat.
 *
 * The frame codec sends a `bigint` as a 64-bit integer wrapped in MessagePack extension 1, the way
 * web.max.ru sends an id, so every digit reaches MAX (`src/protocol/frame.ts`).
