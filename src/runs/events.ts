 * named, byte counts and durations are safe: an id is opaque and can only be correlated by whoever
 * already has the session. A chat title, a person's name, a message body, a phone number or a token
 * are not — not truncated and not hashed (`REQUIREMENTS.md` §14, §24). The fields below are the
 * whole vocabulary, and `idsOf` builds them from named fields rather than filtering a copy of the
 * payload, so there is no path by which an unforeseen field arrives here.
