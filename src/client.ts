     * one, measured against MAX on 2026-09-19: sending the same `cid` twice returned the same
     * message id and left **one** copy in the chat — and it held across two separate connections
     * and logins, which is the case a retry actually faces.
     *
     * So one retry, same `cid`, and nothing beyond that. What is still unmeasured is how long the
     * server remembers a `cid`; the two probes were seconds apart. If the retry also fails the
     * answer is `outcome_unknown` — never failed, never sent — and it names the `cid`, because
     * `max messages send … --cid <n>` can then repeat the attempt without risking a second message.
     *
     * **`at` queues it on MAX** (epoch ms), which sends it then even with this machine off. That is
     * never retried: deduplication by `cid` was measured for ordinary messages only, and a second
     * copy would surface later, where nobody is watching. The guard counts it now, when it is queued.
