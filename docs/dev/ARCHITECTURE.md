# Architecture

How this repository is put together, and which seams you may not cross.

**Status 2026-09-20: this describes working code, not a plan.** Seven operations run against MAX;
`max cache` and `max runs` answer from this machine. Both runtimes pass. Everything here was
verified against the real service unless it says otherwise. Round trip re-verified live 2026-09-20:
`max chats list --limit 3 --verbose --record` made three requests, stdout was one JSON value, stderr
only the event lines.

"Brief §N" is `docs_ai/REQUIREMENTS.md`; rulings (`NEED-nn`) are in
`docs_ai/DECISIONS.md`. Long detail lives in companions under `architecture/`:
[`session.md`](architecture/session.md) (§7), [`messages.md`](architecture/messages.md) (§10),
[`store.md`](architecture/store.md) (§15, §16).

## 1. One published package, four layers, one direction

- Commands are resource + action (`NEED-48`); the diagram matches `max --help`. Adding an operation:
  §12.
- [`@leemour/cli-core`](https://github.com/leemour/cli-core) supplies output streams, renderer,
  error model and exit codes, keyring, config and clocks — the non-MAX half, shared with
  `braze-cli`.
- **One npm package** (`@leemour/max-cli`, command `max`), split by directory, not workspace
  (`NEED-12`). **`src/commands/` may not import from `src/protocol/`, `src/spec/` or
  `src/generated/`**: a Biome rule fails the build with that sentence. Verified by writing the
  forbidden import, both directions.
- **A second rule marks what any messenger CLI could share** (`CLI-30`, `NEED-147`; was `CLI-26`, a number taken three times):
  `src/domain/models.ts`, `src/cache/`, `src/rendering/` and `src/resolve.ts` may not import the
  protocol, the specification, the generated wrappers, the session, the client or the commands.
  The files stay where they are; a future `cli-messenger` package is a move of exactly these, not
  an untangling. `src/domain/map.ts` is outside it on purpose — it is where MAX becomes the model.
  Verified by a forbidden import in each of the four places.

## 2. What each layer may know

| Layer | Knows about | Must never |
|---|---|---|
| `commands/` | `Chat`, `Message`, `Contact`, the renderer, exit codes | opcodes, frames, `ws`, MAX field names |
| `client.ts` | opcodes, the session, the domain model | rendering, `process.stdout`, argv |
| `domain/` | MAX's wire shapes, and only to translate them out | the network, the session |
| `spec/` | every operation, its shape and where it came from | the socket, the session, output |
| `generated/` | what follows from `spec/` | being edited by hand |
| `protocol/` | frames, seq, the socket | who is asking or why — **including the handshake** |
| `session/` | the keyring, the state file, INIT → LOGIN | anything it can ask `cli-core` for |
| `runs/` | what a request cost, and where a record of it goes | what a request *said* — §13 |

Why: if MAX's transport changes, only `protocol/` and `client.ts` change. That is why we own the
adapter instead of depending on `@bruch/max-client` (`NEED-17`).

## 3. The WebSocket is binary, as web.max.ru's is, and ids are the reason to be careful

**Correction 2026-09-25 (`MAX-40`):** this section described text frames `{ver: 11, …}` on
`wss://ws-api.oneme.ru`, and said MessagePack and LZ4 were a TCP-only transport. The web client's
live socket showed otherwise, and we now send what it sends. The capture is
`src/testing/fixtures/web-capture-2026-09-25.json` — proof, not somebody's README.

`wss://api.oneme.ru/websocket`, `Origin: https://web.max.ru`. Every frame is a 10-byte big-endian
header — `ver` (10), `cmd` (0 request, 1 response, 2 event, 3 error), `seq` u16, `opcode` u16,
then `flags << 24 | length` — and a MessagePack body:

- **LZ4 block compression both ways from 32 bytes of body**, `flags = ⌈raw / compressed⌉`, kept
  even when it comes out larger; zero-length body for "no payload". The web client does exactly
  this on every one of 73 recorded frames. zstd (`flags = 0xFF`) was never seen and is refused.
- **Extension type 1 wraps a 64-bit number** — ids and times from MAX, ids from the web client. We
  wrap every `bigint` we send (`toWireId` makes one of every id) and unwrap what arrives.
- **`seq` is two bytes** and starts at 0. It wraps; the `max serve` push filter compares modulo
  65536, because a plain `<=` drops every push after the wrap without a word.

⚠ **Integers.** Message ids have **18 digits** (measured), past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, and times
are 13 — both arrive as 64-bit. The decoder returns a `number` whenever it is exact and a `bigint`
only when it is not; a `bigint` timestamp would break every `Date` above this layer. **Every id
leaves the domain mapper as a string** — an id is never arithmetic. Chat ids reach 14 digits and
contact ids 9 (`pnpm probe:ids`, 2026-09-19).

⚠ **The mock speaks our own codec**, so the suite alone only proves the codec agrees with itself.
What ties it to MAX: LZ4 checked against the reference C library both ways, the compression rule
checked against every recorded frame, and `src/protocol/parity.test.ts` — our INIT, LOGIN and
history requests field by field, in order, beside the web client's.

`seq` is the only link from answer to question: MAX interleaves pushed events with responses on one
socket, so "the next frame is my answer" eventually reads somebody's incoming message.

## 4. One command, one connection, and it closes

- `connect → do the thing → print → close`, the close in a `finally`. `Connection` owns the socket,
  per-request timers and listeners; `close()` clears all three. ⚠ An open WebSocket or live timer
  keeps Node alive, so `max chats list --json | …` would never return: **print-then-hang is a
  defect.**
- `INIT` (6) then `LOGIN` (19) come first; MAX answers nothing before them. The handshake is
  handwritten in `src/session/handshake.ts` and stays so (brief §9); the spec supplies its two
  payloads, so field names have one home, not two. It gets the client's `invoke`, not the socket, so
  both requests are checked and reported like any other (§13).
- LOGIN returns profile, chats, contacts, recent messages and presence, so `account show` and `chats
  list` need **no further request**. `PROFILE` (16) is a profile *update* and refuses an empty
  payload — not used for reading. **Correction 2026-09-24:** it is sent now, by `max account update`
  only (`MAX-33`), with the current first name always included, as the web client does.
- `interactive: false` on login and history (the web client sends `true` for a watching person).
  Whether it moves presence or read state is not settled (`RES-5`).

## 5. Reading is observational, by construction

`CHAT_HISTORY` (49) and `CHAT_MARK` (50) are separate. Nothing that reads sends 50;
`src/client.test.ts` asserts opcode 50 is absent from everything sent. **Correction 2026-09-24:**
this said "we never send 50". Since `CLI-33` it goes out from `client.chats.markRead` only —
`max chats read`, `messages list --mark-read`, and the MCP tool behind `--allow-mark-read` — through
the send guard as kind `read`. Its request is PyMax's shape, not measured (`src/spec/operations/chats.ts`).

⚠ Until the spec landed (2026-09-19) that assertion compared against a missing `Opcode.CHAT_MARK`,
so it read `not.toContain(undefined)` and always passed — `tsconfig.json` excluded test files
from type checking (`OPS-8`). 50 is now a declared opcode with the reason it is never sent.

Not proven: whether `LOGIN` itself moves presence. Needs a second device watching.

## 6. A send may be retried, and only because it was measured

Unlike Braze ("never retry a write"): **`MSG_SEND` carries a client-generated `cid`, and MAX
deduplicates by it.** Measured 2026-09-19 in Saved messages: the same `cid` twice gave the **same
message id** and **one** copy, also across two connections and logins — the case a retry faces.

- A lost send is retried **once, with the same `cid`**. If that fails too, the result is
  `outcome_unknown` (neither failed nor sent) and names the `cid`; `max messages send --cid <n>`
  repeats it without risking a second copy.
- ⚠ Unmeasured: how long MAX remembers a `cid`. Both probes were seconds apart.
- `cid` is monotonic per process. `Date.now()` alone gave two sends in one millisecond the same
  `cid`, and deduplication would have silently dropped the second. A test caught it.
- `--silent` sends `notify: false` (normally `true`). ⚠ **Only `true` is measured**; what MAX does
  with `false` has never been observed (that means messaging somebody), so it may be ignored. The
  first use against a real chat settles it.
- **Every send passes a guard first** (`src/sends/guard.ts`, handed to `MaxClient` by
  `createClient`): a read-only profile (code 5), an optional recipient list (7), an hourly limit
  (8) — all before the socket when the chat is an id. Every outcome, refusals included, goes to
  `<state>/sends/<profile>.jsonl` without the text; the limit counts that file. **Correction
  2026-09-25 (PR #158):** a write that counts first holds a `reserved` line, written under a lock
  file (`wx`, so Windows too), and its outcome settles it; reading folds settled ones away, so two
  processes at the limit cannot both pass. Over `max serve` only the server reserves. These stop a model
  talked into sending by what it read, not an agent that edits the configuration (`NEED-159`).
- **`max serve` runs the same guard on every write it forwards, and journals it** (`NEED-269`):
  anything of the owner's can write to its socket, not only a command that checked first. Every
  request is first checked against the operation's strict schema, as `buildRequest` checks it in a
  command, so a field the specification does not have is refused there too. It reads
  the configuration again for each write, so `config set readOnly true` needs no restart. The
  command still checks — a refusal before an upload — and journals only its own refusals; the
  server writes the rest, with the outcome it saw — one line per attempt. A retry after no answer
  repeats the `cid` in the same chat and leaves `outcome_unknown` then its outcome; the limit counts
  the two once. The first line is not held back for the retry, so a crash cannot lose a message
  that may have gone out. A `cid` that was sent, or reused in another chat, counts as a new send.
- **A forward is a send** — `MSG_SEND` with a `FORWARD` link and no text — so it gets the same one
  retry with the same `cid` and counts against the hourly limit. **An edit and a pin are not
  retried**, like a reaction. **Correction 2026-09-25 (`NEED-282`):** this said neither counts;
  now an edit and a pin that notifies do, and so does each person added to a group; a scheduled
  message counts in the hour it goes out. The guard's other two checks apply to all of them.
- **A deletion is guarded like a send, and each deleted message counts toward the hourly limit**
  (`MAX-47`): it wakes nobody, but many at once is what MAX bans for. At most 10 per call, and
  `--allow-dangerous` on every one. Not retried. `max serve` logs in again after one, since MAX does
  not push a connection's own deletion back to it and the chat's last message may be gone.
- **An edit sends the message's attachments back as history gives them.** Measured 2026-09-24:
  an edit with `attachments: []` removes a photo. So `messages edit` reads the message first, and
  refuses somebody else's message or a forward before asking MAX.

## 7. The session is a token and a stable identity

| What | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| token | OS keyring, service `max-cli`, account = profile | it is the credential |
| `deviceId`, `viewerId`, login count | `<state dir>/profiles/<name>.json`, mode 0600 | identifying, and it must be **stable** |

- **The device identity is saved the first time it is read**, before any use. Otherwise a failed
  login or a second call shows MAX a new device — what brief §34 forbids. Found by a test.
- `MAX_TOKEN` is read before the keyring (CI, probes). `max session start` takes a token four ways
  (`token`, `qr`, `qr-chrome`, `sms`); every one ends in `adoptToken`. `qr-chrome` and `sms` let
  web.max.ru log in inside a throwaway Chromium profile and read `__oneme_auth` over the DevTools
  protocol (`src/session/browser.ts`); `qr` uses our socket (`src/session/login.ts`) and draws the
  code in the terminal. SMS over our socket meets a captcha (measured 2026-09-24), so it has no socket path.

In [`architecture/session.md`](architecture/session.md):

- [Token exchange](architecture/session.md#the-token-is-replaced-when-it-has-gone-stale-and-kept)
  (`MAX-11`, measured 2026-09-22): LOGIN returns a new token once the old one has aged, then the same
  one. Stored after the account check; a keyring failure does not fail the command; never printed.
- [Login first, profile bound to one account](architecture/session.md#the-login-happens-first-and-the-profile-is-bound-to-an-account)
  (`MAX-12`, measured 2026-09-21): a token reaches the keyring only after MAX accepts it
  (`src/session/adopt.ts`); a profile refuses another account's token.
- [The login asks for a delta](architecture/session.md#the-login-asks-for-a-delta) (`MAX-10`,
  `NEED-103`, measured 2026-09-20, `pnpm probe:contacts`): the four `*Sync` fields are timestamps; we
  send the stored marker, written in one transaction with its rows. `max contacts sync` forgets it.
- [Chat members are named](architecture/session.md#a-chat-carries-its-members-and-we-ask-who-they-are):
  every group and dialog participant via `CONTACT_INFO`, batched at 100; channels skipped. 23 people
  in chats against 6 contacts (2026-09-20).

## 8. We look like the official client

Nothing on the wire names this tool (brief §34): `WEB_USER_AGENT` in `src/spec/identity.ts` is the
web client's shape, `Origin` is `https://web.max.ru`, the device identity is stable per profile.
We use `ws`, not Node's built-in `WebSocket`: measured on both runtimes, `ws` sends custom headers
identically; the built-in's support depends on the bundled undici version.

## 9. A name is never resolved by guessing

- `max messages list "Ivan"` matches chat titles as a fragment. **Correction 2026-09-25:** this said
  "exact first"; an exact title no longer wins while another title contains it too. **An ambiguous
  name is an error listing the candidates** — a send to the wrong chat does not undo. Verified live
  (a full contact name matched two chats; the command stopped). Candidates print one per line with
  ids, and in the machine error as `candidates: [{ id, title }]`, so an agent picks one without
  parsing a sentence.
- A dialog has no title, so the partner's name comes from contacts: one `CONTACT_INFO` (32) for all
  unknown partners. Measured: 6 contacts in the login against 17 dialog partners; named dialogs went
  from 0 of 17 to 16 of 17.
- The same lookup names **group senders** (`FIND-45`). The login names contacts only, so on
  2026-09-22 every sender in a real group but the owner was a bare id. After a history read, unnamed
  ids are looked up in the store, then in one `CONTACT_INFO`, and kept; the next read of that chat
  asks nothing. A refused lookup leaves the ids, notes it on stderr, and still answers.
- ⚠ Opcode 36 is `CONTACT_LIST` in tsmax and PyMax but `GET_BLOCKED` in the protocol documentation.
  **Not used** — not a difference to discover in production.

## 10. Output: stdout is data, stderr is everything else

`--json`, or any non-terminal stdout: **one JSON value on stdout and nothing else** — no spinner,
`✓`, warning or ANSI. Diagnostics go to stderr in every mode, so the contract holds by construction.
Verified live: stdout one JSON value, stderr empty. Failures too: `run()` returns an exit code
(never throws), the error goes to stderr (JSON when piped, a sentence in a terminal), codes from
`cli-core` (`4` authentication, `130` interrupt). Scripts branch on the code, never on text.

### A listing answers one object, always the same one

```json
{ "items": [ … ], "page": 1, "limit": 20, "hasMore": true }
```

- `chats list`, `contacts list`, `messages list`, every machine mode — also `--all` (`page: 1`,
  `hasMore: false`) and `--offline`. **The shape never says where rows came from**; exit code and
  diagnostics do.
- `hasMore` is a boolean, not a total (counting rows MAX has not sent is another cost). Exact for
  chats and contacts. ⚠ **For `messages list` it is a claim about our copy**: history comes in
  windows, and a full page is the only evidence of another.
- In a terminal, the "more pages" line goes to **stderr**, from `src/commands/paging.ts`, not
  `renderer.result`: `account show` and `session start|end` are not listings and answer a bare
  object.

User-facing version: [`../usage.md`](../usage.md). Messages print as a feed, not a table; a message id
holds its send time (`id >> 16`, measured 2026-09-22); a photo link opens without a token
(`NEED-120`); a reply carries the other message whole —
[`architecture/messages.md`](architecture/messages.md).

## 11. Trade-off order

When two conflict, the earlier wins:

```text
correctness > not touching someone's account by accident > auditability
> agent determinism > human UX > protocol coverage > implementation cleverness
```

The second ranks high because this is a real personal account: an unwanted send, a read receipt or a
message deleted by a retry happened to a person.

## 12. One operation, declared once

Every opcode and payload shape lives in `src/spec/`; its Valibot schemas **are** the definition
(`NEED-7`). `src/generated/` follows from it and is never edited by hand.

| Generated, committed, checked in CI | Handwritten, and staying that way |
|---|---|
| `src/generated/opcodes.generated.ts` — the registry | the socket, `seq` correlation, timeouts |
| `src/generated/operations.generated.ts` — the table | the INIT → LOGIN handshake |
| `src/generated/client.generated.ts` — wire wrappers | the schemas themselves — they are the spec |
| [`../protocol.md`](../protocol.md) — the reference page | the domain mapping, and error classification |

### Adding one

1. In `src/spec/operations/<subject>.ts`, `defineOperation`: dotted `name`, MAX's `constant`, the
   opcode, a **strict** request shape, a **loose** response shape, where the shape came from, and
   its **`guard`** — `null` when nobody else sees it, otherwise what the send guard is asked, read
   from the request as it goes on the wire. The field is required: `max serve` passes a write on
   only through that declaration (`NEED-269`), and a request it cannot read — a send with no chat
   that is not a new group, a chat update that is two changes — is refused, never guessed.
2. `pnpm generate`. A duplicate opcode or name, or a name not `<group>.<method>`, stops it with a
   sentence naming both sides.
3. Call it from `MaxClient`. The generated wrapper is typed and stays internal.

**A known number we will not send gets `reserveOpcode`**, with the reason: it is in the registry but
never gets a method, so "do not call it because it is in the enum" is enforced by code.

### Two directions, two schemas

- **Requests are strict**: an unknown field is refused before the socket.
- **Responses are loose**: new fields pass through, fields we do not use are optional, nothing in a
  response fails a command (brief §29, `NEED-35`). Each answer is still checked against the spec; a
  mismatch is **one line on stderr**, so a renamed field does not silently blank a column.
- ⚠ **That note is built by hand from the field path and expected type.** Valibot's message quotes
  the value, which may be somebody's message (brief §14, §24). A test asserts no body reaches a
  note.

### An id is a string above the codec and a `bigint` on the wire

`asId` reads; `id()` in `src/spec/scalars.ts` writes. It replaced `Number(chatId)`, which silently
rounds past 15 digits (`Number("7268926000000000001")` is a different chat). Ids below 2⁵³ give the
same bytes as before. **It never mattered yet**: measured 2026-09-19, nothing the login returned was
past 2⁵³ (longest chat id 14 digits). Hardening, so nobody re-asks.

### Staleness

`pnpm generate` writes and formats in one step; CI regenerates and asserts no diff (`OPS-3`). The
banner has no date or version — anything that moves on its own makes that check fail forever.

## 13. One event per request, and the two places it can go

Each request is one object: direction, operation, opcode, `seq`, ids named, duration, bytes, how
many things came back. **Two sinks**: `--trace` renders it on stderr live; `--record` writes it to a
file. Either, both, or (default) neither. What it looks like and how to use it:
[`../diagnostics.md`](../diagnostics.md).

```text
→ session.login     op 19  seq 2  871 B
← session.login     op 19  seq 2  213ms  48.0 kB  25 chats  6 contacts
```

- **Never in an event: a chat title, a person's name, a message body, a phone number, a token** —
  not truncated, not hashed (brief §14, §24). Ids are in: opaque, only the session holder can
  correlate them, and every real complaint is about one conversation.
- ⚠ This holds because `idsOf` in `src/runs/events.ts` **builds the event from named fields instead
  of filtering the payload** (a filter lets an unseen field through). No branch reaches
  `session.login`'s `token`. Pino's redaction is the second line of defence.
- `MaxClient` takes an injected event sink, like `warn` — it reports, never decides where. The hook
  is in `#send` (builds, times, checks).
- ⚠ **`startSession` gets the client's `invoke`, not the socket** (since 2026-09-20). Before, it
  called `connection.invoke`, so INIT and LOGIN bypassed the hook, and `chats list` (nothing sent
  beyond LOGIN) recorded an empty run. It also made LOGIN's answer checked against the spec, which
  found `messages` is an object, not an array (`PROTO-6`).
- A request refused **before** the socket (bad id, unknown field) emits no event; the run still
  records outcome and code.
- **A local answer gets its own event shape**: no opcode, `seq` or bytes ("0 bytes" would be
  fiction), plus a `reason`: `offline` (caller said never connect) or `history` (window older than a
  fetch returns, so the record is authoritative). "Did not ask" and "nothing to ask" differ; only
  the second is the local copy doing its job.

### The run directory

`<state dir>/runs/<UTC day>/<timestamp>-<command>-<suffix>/` with `run.json` and `events.jsonl`.
[`../diagnostics.md`](../diagnostics.md) has the layout, modes (`0700`/`0600`), the twice-written
`run.json` (`running`, then the outcome) and 30-day retention, pruned only when a recorded run
starts, whole days by directory name. Rules not stated there:

- **Off unless asked** (`NEED-49`, `NEED-52`): `--record`, `--no-record`, else the config file.
  **Correction 2026-09-25 (`NEED-268`, `OPS-14`):** a run that fails is kept anyway —
  `recorded()` holds the newest 500 events in memory and opens the directory only on a failure,
  with `keptBecauseFailed: true`. Recording turned off by name (`--no-record`, `"record": false`)
  keeps nothing (`keepFailedRuns` in `src/config.ts`).
  **Correction 2026-09-25 (`OPS-15`):** every failure, not only one inside `run()`. The last catch
  of `run` in `src/program.ts` hands anything no run settled (`wasSettled`) to the same `recorded()`:
  Commander's usage errors, checks made before a command opens its run, commands that never open
  one. The run is named by the command's words only (`commandPath`), never the arguments.
- **Beyond requests**: `warning` events carry a code from a closed list (`WarningCode`), never
  the sentence; a crash adds a `crash` event with the class and up to ten `function file:line`
  frames, never the message; `maxError` is MAX's refusal key when it is shaped like one
  (`maxErrorKey`, `src/runs/events.ts`). `run.json` carries `runtime`, `platform`, `arch`.
- `run.json` is written atomically. `finish` runs on every path and **awaits the logger**: Pino
  appends via a plain stream, and a process that exits first loses the tail — the part somebody
  wanted.
- The day directory is UTC: a run at 01:35 in Madrid lands under the previous day.
- **Files, not the SQLite cache** (`NEED-51`): opposite lifecycles, and two `max` runs can overlap.
  Two appends never conflict; two DB writers take a lock, and a diagnostic must not fail its
  command.
- `max runs list | show <id> | path <id>` read them back. An empty list explains itself on stderr
  and names `--record`. **`runs path` answers `{"path": "…"}` too** (`NEED-88`, `max runs path <id>
  --json | jq -r .path`; a terminal gets the path on a labelled line): a contract with no exception
  is one nobody has to remember, and was worth more than `cat "$(max runs path <id>)/events.jsonl"`.

## 14. Settings, and the order one is decided in

**Flag → environment → config file → built-in default**, decided once in `resolveSettings`
(`src/config.ts`). Commands take what they are given; one that re-derived the order would disagree.
Every field, variable and the file format: [`../configuration.md`](../configuration.md); profiles and
paging for users: [`../usage.md`](../usage.md). The profile follows the same order: the first word
(`max personal chats list`), then `MAX_PROFILE=personal`, then `"defaultProfile"` in the file, then
`default`.

### The profile is the first word, not a flag

- `--profile` was deleted (`NEED-45`). The first word is the profile **unless it names a command**
  (`liftProfile` in `src/profile.ts`). It must come first: `max --json personal chats` reads
  `personal` as a command and fails.
- ⚠ **A profile named after a command could never be selected** (`max chats` must mean the command),
  so `max session start` refuses the name (`refuseCommandName`) — creation is the only moment to
  explain it. Names become file names and keyring accounts: letters, digits, `.`, `-`, `_` only.
- An unknown first word gets `authentication_error` naming that profile and the fix
  (`max x session start`, not `max session start`, which would log in the wrong profile). `max chat
  list` is the everyday case; the message says which word was read as what.

### The file and paging

What a user sets and how: [`../configuration.md`](../configuration.md), [`../usage.md`](../usage.md). The rules
behind it:

- `~/.config/max-cli/config.json`, mode `0644`, read by `cli-core`'s `loadConfigFile`. A missing
  file is not an error; a malformed one is, in every output mode, naming the field.
- The schema is `strictObject`: `"limitt"` is reported as `profiles.default.limitt`, where plain
  `object()` would drop it silently. The **opposite** of MAX answers, whose unknown fields are kept
  (`NEED-35`).
- **No field can hold a secret** (token, phone, chat id). Having nowhere to put one beats a rule.
- `timeoutMs` unset is the transport's 30 s (`src/protocol/connection.ts`); `color` unset means
  decide from the terminal.
- `--limit`, `--page` (1-based), `--all` on every listing, resolved once in `resolveSettings`;
  `--page` with `--all` is a `validation_error`. Neither `--page` nor `--all` has a config field — a
  page number in a file is nobody's setting. Paging is SQL `LIMIT ? OFFSET ?` over the store.
- ⚠ **A page number over a live list can repeat or skip a row** (newest first; a new message shifts
  the boundary). Documented in `--help`, not engineered away.
- `messages list` pages with `--before` instead, anchored in time (`chats.history` takes `from`), so
  it is exact. It takes a message id, or an ISO 8601 time when the id is gone.
- ⚠ **A bare integer is always an id.** Ids have 18 digits, ms timestamps 13; telling them apart by
  size breaks when either changes.
- `contacts list --order recent|name` has no config field: a second spelling of a flag is how
  `--profile` came to be deleted.

### Two things that jump the queue

- **`MAX_TOKEN` outranks the keyring** (`cli-core`'s `Credentials.read`) — a token for a container
  or probe without storing it.
- ⚠ **`MAX_CONFIG_DIR`, `MAX_STATE_DIR` and `MAX_CACHE_DIR` change which keyring entry a profile
  means.** `pathsAreOverridden` makes the service `max-cli:<configDir>`, so a login made with them
  is invisible without them ("no session" for a profile that exists). Same environment for both, or
  neither. This cost an afternoon (`UX-1`).

### Diagnostics all leave by one door

`--quiet` silences diagnostics only; a failure still prints, since an exit code says what kind of
thing failed but not which chat (`src/output.ts`). A `MaxClient` is built in exactly one place
(`src/commands/context.ts`), which hands it the renderer's `note`. Before, the protocol note went
straight to stderr, so `--quiet` missed it and `--json` did not shape it (`BUG-7`). Six commands
each remembering to pass a `warn` is a rule that breaks once and then stays invisible; one
construction site cannot.

## 15. The store: people, and the chats they are in

The cache database (`<cache dir>/<profile>.db`, mode `0600`, `SCHEMA_VERSION` 4) is **a record and
an offline source, never a way to skip a request**. Every read still asks MAX, since the login
returns chats, contacts and recent messages anyway; `--offline` alone answers from the record
without connecting. No freshness window: a stored person is valid until told otherwise.
`--offline` reaches the client in one place (`createClient` in `src/commands/context.ts`), and a
send under it is refused — until 2026-09-23 the flag reached no command, so `--offline messages
send` would have sent.

In [`architecture/store.md`](architecture/store.md):

- [A group member is a person, not a contact](architecture/store.md#a-group-member-is-a-person-not-a-contact)
  (`NEED-105`): `people` + `chat_members`; a contact is whoever shares a `dialog`, decided by the
  query. Group members are stored but never in `contacts list`. `chat_members` alone deletes, per chat.
- [A version bump is a rebuild, except for the history](architecture/store.md#a-version-bump-is-a-rebuild-except-for-the-history):
  `migrate` drops and recreates every table but `messages` and `ranges`, whose rows are carried
  over (`MAX-44`); a newer file is refused.
- [It never fails the command](architecture/store.md#it-never-fails-the-command): falls back to the
  login's data and says why on stderr (`NEED-97`).

## 16. Searching, and why it is FTS5 rather than `LIKE`

Three external-content FTS5 indexes (`chats_fts`, `people_fts`, `messages_fts`), `trigram`
tokenizer, kept in sync by triggers. `LIKE`, `lower()` and `COLLATE NOCASE` fold ASCII only and miss
Cyrillic names; `trigram` matches inside words like `chats.resolve`'s `includes()`. `max messages
search` never connects, so it finds what has been read, not what exists. Measurements, the three
traps (short queries, input as FTS5 syntax, index drift) and the offline rule:
[`architecture/store.md`](architecture/store.md#searching-why-fts5-and-not-like).

## 17. The MCP server is a second adapter, and it keeps the connection for minutes

`max mcp` (`src/mcp/`) is a sibling of `src/commands/`, not a layer under it (REQUIREMENTS §6): each
tool calls `MaxClient`, and the Biome rule that keeps commands off `protocol/`, `spec/` and
`generated/` covers `src/mcp/` too. The context comes from `contextFor` — the same settings,
keyring, deadline and run record as a command, built from flags instead of argv.

- **One connection per agent session, never for long** (`NEED-152`): `MaxSession` logs in on the
  first call and keeps the client; it drops it after 2 minutes idle, 5 minutes after the login
  whatever the traffic (the chat list is the login's snapshot), after any error that may have been
  the connection's, and on stdin EOF. Calls run one at a time.
- **Sending is absent, not refused**, without `--allow-send`. With it, the tool carries
  `destructiveHint` and Claude Code's `anthropic/requiresUserInteraction`, and goes through the same
  `MaxClient.messages.send` as the command — so the send guards apply unchanged.
- **`--confirm-send` asks the owner from the server** (`CLI-28`, `src/mcp/confirm.ts`): the first
  call resolves the chat and returns an elicitation form showing its title, id and the text; only
  the SDK's second call, carrying Accept, sends. The form has no fields — Accept is the
  "yes"; a required checkbox under it was missed and made Accept look broken. The form's `requestState` is an
  HMAC of chat and text under a per-process key, recomputed from the second call's own arguments —
  state round-trips through the client. Clients on the 2025 protocol (Claude Code over stdio) get
  the same flow through the SDK's legacy shim; a client without form support fails before the
  second call. Tested on both protocol eras.
- **Discovery is the client's.** Clients that defer tools keep only the names and the server's
  `instructions` in context; `instructions` is `max --help` plus the skill's boundaries, under the
  2048 characters Claude Code keeps. No meta-tools, no tool with an `action` parameter: approval is
  per tool name, and one tool for reading and sending would share one approval.
- **stdout is the protocol.** Nothing in `src/mcp/` writes data through the renderer; notes go to
  stderr. The process exits on stdin EOF — measured 110 ms under Node and Bun, 2026-09-24.
- `serveStdio` may build a probe server before settling on the protocol era, so the server is a
  factory over one `MaxSession`, never one instance.

User side: [`../mcp.md`](../mcp.md). The research behind the choices is local-only
(`docs_ai/plans/2026-09-23-mcp-research.md`).

## 18. The bot API is a separate slice, generated from the official schema

`max …` is the personal account over the unofficial protocol; `max bot …` (`CLI-25`) is a bot over
MAX's official HTTP Bot API. The two share no transport, no session and no
generated code. Nothing under `src/bot/` imports `src/protocol/`, `src/session/` or
`src/generated/`, and the other way round.

```
spec/bot/schema.yaml        the official OpenAPI document, committed with provenance.json
   │  pnpm bot:spec:sync    — the only step that reads the network, and only when run by hand
   ▼
scripts/bot/openapi-adapter.ts   OpenAPI → cli-core's format-neutral ApiModel; strict, names what it refuses
scripts/bot/overrides.ts         read / write / destructive, where the HTTP method is wrong
   │  pnpm bot:generate     — part of `pnpm generate`, so CI's freshness check covers it
   ▼
src/bot/generated/{types,schemas,manifest}.ts   docs/dev/bot-api-coverage.md
```

The generator itself is `@leemour/cli-core/codegen`, shared with other CLIs; only the adapter from
OpenAPI is ours. The generated Valibot schemas keep the schema's constraints and turn a 64-bit id
into an exact decimal string. They expect numbers from `lossless-json`, and they decode only — a
request is validated with them and then sent as the original lossless value. Enums and
discriminated unions are strict, so an update type newer than the snapshot fails validation.

At run time: `src/commands/bot.ts` → `src/bot/client.ts` (the only door to the generated code) →
`src/bot/transport.ts`. The transport sends the token as the bare `Authorization` header, parses
with `lossless-json`, repeats only reads (429, 502, 503, no answer; `Retry-After` first), and turns a
write that got no answer into `outcome_unknown`. It trusts the Минцифры root that signs
`platform-api2.max.ru` inside this process only: Node's process-wide default CA list (22.19+), or
per request on Bun (`NEED-293`). The bot token is `bot:<profile>` in the keyring (`src/bot/auth.ts`).
A Biome rule keeps `src/bot/` away from `src/protocol/`, `src/session/`, `src/spec/` and
`src/client.ts`.
