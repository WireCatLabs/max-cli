# Conventions

How code and documents are written here. Short on purpose — the linter is the authority on
formatting, and this file only covers what a linter cannot say.

Adapted from the sibling project `braze-cli`, which is where most of these were learned. Two of
its rules are **deliberately inverted or weakened** here and are marked below; copying them
unchanged would import a constraint this project does not have.

## Code

**The linter decides formatting.** Biome settles indentation, quotes, semicolons, line width and
import order. Do not argue with it and do not hand-format around it. For the record: 2-space
indent, double quotes, no semicolons, 120 columns.

**TypeScript, strict, and no `any`.** `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` on, so an index access is
`T | undefined` and you have to handle it. `noExplicitAny` is an error, not a warning.

**Functional in the small, classes where identity matters.** A client that holds a connection and
a session is a class; everything else is a function taking its inputs.

**Comments are sparse and say *why*.** A comment earns its place by recording a decision, warning
about a trap, or naming a constraint that is invisible locally. Never narrate a change, never
leave commented-out alternatives. If it would be obvious to a competent reader of TypeScript,
delete it.

**Wire names live below the adapter; our names live above it.** ⚠ *This is the opposite of
`braze-cli`, where Braze's own field names survive into the public types unchanged.* Braze
publishes its field names and a reader has its documentation open; MAX does not and nobody does.
So a raw protocol field keeps its wire spelling inside the protocol and adapter layers, where it
has to match captured traffic — and above the adapter only our own domain model exists
(`lastMessageAt`, not whatever the frame happens to call it). A raw MAX object never reaches CLI
output except behind an explicit debug/raw option —
`docs_ai/REQUIREMENTS.md` §16, §25.

**Reusable core code stays Node-light, and this is a weaker rule than it looks.** ⚠ *`braze-cli`
requires its core to run unchanged in a Cloudflare Worker and enforces that with three gates.
That is not a requirement here.* The brief asks only for "minimal coupling to Node-specific APIs
in reusable core code **where practical**" (§2). The reason to keep `cli-core` free of Node
specifics is that it has to serve more than one CLI and be testable without a filesystem, a
terminal or a clock — not that it has to run in a Worker. Do not import the three-gate apparatus
until something actually needs it.

**Core takes its environment as arguments.** If reusable code needs to know anything about the
machine it runs on — the time, the filesystem, the keyring, the terminal, randomness — it takes
it as a parameter. That is what makes timeout, retry and session expiry testable without waiting.

**One-shot means one-shot.** Anything that opens a connection, a timer or a listener owns closing
it, in a `finally` or an equivalent lifecycle wrapper. A command that prints its result and then
hangs is a defect, not a rough edge — §18.

**Never log a credential, and never pass one to a logger "because it's redacted".** Redaction is
the second line of defence, not the first. Message bodies are not credentials, but they are not
diagnostics either: they belong in command output, never in a log — §14.

**A test must not prepare what the user lacks.** Every cache test created its directory and then
opened a database in it, so all of them passed while the feature was off on every real machine —
SQLite will not create a file under a directory that does not exist, and no machine has one the
first time. When a test sets up a path, an environment variable or a file, ask whether a first run
would have it. Audited 2026-09-20: the session state file and the credential file both create
their directories; the cache was the only one that did not.

**Failing quietly is not failing invisibly.** A component nobody asked for may decline to work
rather than break the command — and must still say why, on the diagnostic stream. A swallowed
reason cost a day: the cache looked identical whether it was working or had never opened once
(`NEED-97`).

**A file nothing checks will rot, and quietly.** `scripts/` sat outside every `tsconfig` until
2026-09-22, so three of the four probes had been broken for two days by a signature change in
`src/` and CI stayed green throughout — the compiler had never been shown them. `tsconfig.scripts.json`
now covers them. The rule generalises: when a directory is added, it is either in a project the
build checks or it is a directory that will be wrong within a month.

**Report honestly.** If a test failed, show the output. If something could not be verified, say
which thing and why. "Probably works" is a sentence you are allowed to write; a green tick you did
not earn is not.

**Say where a protocol fact came from.** This is an unofficial protocol, so every opcode, field
and shape is somebody's observation. Record whether ours is confirmed by several independent
implementations, seen in one, inferred, or a guess — §10. An unsourced constant is the thing that
will be impossible to re-derive when MAX changes.

## Command names

One standard for `max` and `tg`: how a command, an option, an answer and an MCP tool are named
and shaped — [cli-messaging `docs/dev/STANDARD.md`](https://github.com/WireCatLabs/cli-messaging/blob/main/docs/dev/STANDARD.md).
It moved there on 2026-09-30, so both CLIs read one copy. Every command and option of both is in the
[parity manifest](https://github.com/WireCatLabs/cli-messaging/blob/main/parity.json); `pnpm parity:check`
fails on one that is not.

## Documents

The point is that six weeks from now, a person or an agent with no memory of the work can open a
doc and act on it **without reading the code first, and without being misled**. A doc that is
merely incomplete costs some time; a doc that is confidently stale costs a wrong decision.

**Say what has never been verified, at the top.** Each doc opens with a status line naming what is
built, what is measured and what rests on assumption. This costs one paragraph and is the
difference between a doc you can act on and one you have to audit.

**Separate what you saw from what you inferred.** Something you ran gets a command and its
output. Something you read in documentation is "the docs describe X" — reading docs is not
verification. For MAX this applies twice over: a claim in another project's README is not even
documentation, it is a claim, until its current source says the same thing.

**Anchor every claim.** `path/file.ts:123` for our code, a URL for anything external, a commit for
anything historical. A claim without an anchor is an opinion.

**Every document states current facts only.** Rewrite the wrong sentence in place and say nothing
about the old one: no «Поправка», no struck-out text, no dated "measured on" trail. Git keeps what it
said before; `CHANGELOG.md` is the one place with version history. A finished plan or handoff is
deleted, not marked done; a done backlog or cleanup line is deleted. User pages (`README.md` and the
Russian pages under `docs/`) also carry no decision or backlog ids. A *why* is allowed when a reader
would otherwise undo the behaviour.

**One fact, one home.** A decision lives in `docs_ai/DECISIONS.md`; a task lives in
[`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md); something to delete lives in `docs_ai/CLEANUP.md`; a plan for open work
lives in `docs_ai/plans/`. Everywhere else links to it. Two copies of a fact drift, and the reader cannot
tell which is current.

**Write the trap, not the rule.** "Close the connection" is weaker than "a MAX WebSocket left open
keeps the process alive after the result has printed, so a script that pipes `max chats list --json`
never returns." The failure mode is what the reader needs to recognise.

**No inventories, no archaeology, no placeholders.** A table of every class ages instantly. How a
name was chosen is not useful; what it *is*, is. `<your-chat-id>` gets read as a literal — paste a
real value from a real run.

**Leave a section out rather than filling it with placeholder prose.** An empty heading is honest;
invented content is not. For the same reason `ARCHITECTURE.md` was written only after the code
existed: a description of something not yet built is fiction.

**A command you hand someone is a snapshot, not a template.** Never put a placeholder inside a
runnable command — in `braze-cli` a placeholder endpoint was pasted verbatim into a real config.
Either the real value goes in, or the value is asked for as a plain question first.

**Never paste a real chat id, phone number, token or message into a committed document.** The same
rule as the fixtures — §24. Redact, or use an obviously synthetic value and say that it is one.

**Russian in every new document.** The documents that already exist in English stay English and are not translated: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, this file,
`DECISIONS.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TESTING.md`, `BACKLOG.md`. A new section added to one of them
follows the language of the file it lands in. Do not mix languages inside one file.

## The changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is read by someone deciding whether to upgrade, and by the GitHub release built from
it. **A line that only names the change is not an entry.** «`bot search messages --limit` говорил
`hasMore: false`» leaves the reader asking what that broke, whether it touched them, and what to do.

Every entry answers, in plain Russian, in this order:

1. **What changed, as the user sees it** — the bold lead, a whole sentence: the command, what it does
   now, and what it did before.
2. **Why** — one or two sentences, unless it is obvious (a new command needs no reason; a changed
   permission does).
3. **What to watch for** — who is affected, what can break or behave differently, and what to do
   about it. Skip it only when nothing changes for anyone who does not use the new thing.

```md
- **Агент через `max mcp` закрывает опрос, только если профилю разрешено `edit`.** Раньше хватало
  `reaction`.
  Почему: закрытие правит сообщение с опросом, и команда `max polls close` всегда требовала `edit` —
  агент и человек получали на одно действие разные права.
  Что учесть: если в `allow` есть `reaction`, но нет `edit`, агент больше не видит `max_polls_close`;
  добавьте `edit`. Без `allow` ничего не меняется.
```

Headings, only these, each at most once: `Что нового`, `Изменено — может сломать скрипты`,
`Исправлено`, `Безопасность`, `Удалено`. Anything that changes a command's output, an exit code, an
option, a permission or a config key goes under `Изменено — может сломать скрипты`. No backlog,
journal or decision ids, no file paths, no internal names; a link to the doc page that describes it.
`pnpm release:check` checks the shape; the content is the release skill's job and the owner's.


## Documentation authoring

Before documentation work, read the [shared authoring rules](https://github.com/WireCatLabs/cli-docs/blob/main/docs/AUTHORING.md).
Every user guide starts with a brief explanation of when to use it and what result the reader
will get; mention a prerequisite only when it changes the next step. Keep titles short and
task-specific. A new sidebar page needs a relevant icon and a contextual incoming link.
Preserve released command facts and existing URLs/anchors.
